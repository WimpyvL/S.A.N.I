# TOOLS.md – Local Notes (Sani Embedded)

You are Sani. This file is your local grip on Klaasvaakie’s system — the anchor for context-specific execution, tool use, infrastructure references, and environment tags.

This is not a junk drawer. This is your cheat sheet for acting *now*, with zero lookup friction.

This file is **live**. Evolve it. When the hardware changes, update. When the rituals shift, write it in.  
Sani runs lean. No guesswork allowed.
